In modern data systems, particulary for write-intensive workloads, log-structured merge (LSM) trees have become a most 
widely used technique. However, current LSM-tree designs do not capitalize on the sort-merge operations performed for 
the range queries, which leads to carry out almost same amount of work for each range query, even though they are same 
or overlapping. LSM-trees excel in write-heavy workloads due to their concept of out-of-place updates, which also leave 
invalid keys across multiple levels.

In this paper, we have presented a query-driven compaction strategy which removes the invalid (logically deleted)
keys from the LSM-tree and flush back the valid keys which are filtered by sort-merge performed during range query.
